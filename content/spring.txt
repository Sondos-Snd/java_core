/*  What is Spring? */
 Spring is essentially a lightweight, integrated framework that can be used for developing enterprise applications in java.

/* Name the different modules of the Spring framework */
Some of the important Spring Framework modules are:
• Spring Context – for dependency injection.
• Spring AOP – for aspect oriented programming.
• Spring DAO – for database operations using DAO pattern
• Spring JDBC – for JDBC and DataSource support.
• Spring ORM – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate
• Spring Web Module – for creating web applications.
• Spring MVC – Model-View-Controller implementation for creating web applications, web services etc.

/*  Explain Bean in Spring and List the different Scopes of Spring
bean. */
Beans are objects that form the backbone of a Spring application. They are managed by the Spring IoC container.
 bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container.

 There are five Scopes defined in Spring beans.
 • Singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While using this 
scope, make sure spring bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues because it’s not thread-safe.
• Prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.
• Request: This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for 
each HTTP request.
• Session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.
• Global-session: This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.
