/*  What is the difference between Error and Exception? */
error: An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime. Such as OutOfMemory error. These JVM errors you cannot repair them at runtime.
While exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input or human error etc. e.g. FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not
exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference. In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by
giving the user feedback for entering proper values etc.

/* How can you handle Java exceptions? */
1. try
2. catch
3. finally
4. throw
5. throws

/* What are the differences between Checked Exception and
Unchecked Exception? */
checked: The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. checked at compile-time.: IOException, SQLException etc
unchecked: extend RuntimeException. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException.

/* Will the finally block get executed when the return statement is 
written at the end of try block and catch block as shown below? */
There are only a few situations in which the finally block does not execute, such as VM crash, power failure, software crash, etc. If 
you don’t want to execute the finally block, you need to call the System.exit()  method explicitly in the finally block.

/* . How does an exception propagate in the code? */
If an exception is not caught, it is thrown from the top of the stack and falls 
down the call stack to the previous procedure. 

/* Can you explain the Java thread lifecycle? */
New, Runnable, Waiting, Terminated

/* What purpose do the keywords final, finally, and finalize fulfill? */
final: Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method, and variable. A final class
can’t be inherited, final method can’t be overridden and final variable value can’t be changed. 

finally: Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether the
exception is handled or not. 

finalize: Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before the object is garbage
collected. 

/*  What are the differences between throw and throws? */
throw: Checked exceptions can not be propagated with throw only.You cannot throw multiple exception. Throw is followed by an instance.
throws: Throws is used to declare an exception. Checked exception can be propagated with throws. Throws is followed by class. Throws is used with the method signature.

/* What is exception hierarchy in java? */
Throwable (class)
exception ( checked, uncheked) + error (virtual machine, assertion)

/* How to create a custom Exception? */
 class New1Exception extends Exception { }

/* . What are the important methods of Java Exception Class? */
Methods are defined in the base class Throwable. Some of the important methods of Java exception class are stated below.
1. String getMessage() – This method returns the message String about the exception. The message can be provided through its constructor.
2. public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace() – This method returns an array containing each element on the stack trace. The element at
index 0 represents the top of the call stack whereas the last element in the array represents the method at the bottom of the call stack.
3. Synchronized Throwable getCause() – This method returns the cause of the exception or null id as represented by a Throwable object.
4. String toString() – This method returns the information in String format. The returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized
message.
5. void printStackTrace() – This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream.

/*  What are the differences between processes and threads? */
thread is subset of process, which is run by operating system and which only exercice control over child processes and run in seperate memory spaces.

/* What is a finally block? Is there a case when finally will not execute? */
Finally block is a block which always executes a set of statements. It is alwaysassociated with a try block regardless of any exception that occurs or not.
Yes, finally will not be executed if the program exits either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort.

/* . What is synchronization? */
Synchronization refers to multi-threading.A synchronized block of code can be executed by only one thread at a time.

/* . What is OutOfMemoryError in Java? */
OutOfMemoryError is the subclass of java.lang.Error which generally occurs 
when our JVM runs out of memory.

/*  What is a Thread? */
A thread is the smallest piece of programmed instructions which can be
executed independently by a scheduler. 

/*  What are the two ways to create a thread? */
• By implementing the Runnable interface.  the class must implement the public void run() 
• By extending the Thread: This creates a thread by creating an instance of a new class that extends the 
Thread class. The extending class must override the run() function, which is the thread’s entry point.

/* . What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java? */
Javaprovides four types of garbage collectors:
• Serial Garbage Collector
• Parallel Garbage Collector
• CMS Garbage Collector
• G1 Garbage Collector

/* Java works as “pass by value” or “pass by reference” phenomenon? */
Java is always pass-by-value. This means that it creates a copy of the contents 
of the parameter in memory. In Java, object variables always refer to the memory heap’s real object.
