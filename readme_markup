1. Headings
Same as in HTML, here you have 6 headings.

Code :-

# Heading1
## Heading2
### Heading3
#### Heading4
##### Heading5
###### Heading6


Headings
A line is given by default for Heading1 and Heading2. Others are without it.

2. Line Breaks
For a line break or writing to a new line you can either opt the markdown way or the HTML way. Both works fine.

Markdown :- To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and hit enter.

Markdown Way
of breaking

Sorry, they won‚Äôt allow more than 1 space here so copy pasting the above code won‚Äôt work for you.

HTML :- Just add the break tag (<br>)

HTML way <br>
of breaking


Line Breaks
3. Emphasis
Bold and Italic are the 2 emphasis modes. It adds a little weight to your monotonous text.

Bold :- Doubles are for bold

**Bold**
__Bold__

Italic :- Singles are for italic

*Italic*
_Italic_

What if we want both, a HYBRID ?

***Hybrid***
___Hybird___
**_Hybrid_**
*__Hybrid__*


4. Blockquotes
Blockquotes are quotes that are set off from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text.

Code :- (The > on 2nd line is for an empty line in )

> This is a blockquote
>
> This is next line


Nested Blockquote

> This is main Blockquote
> >This is nested Blockquote
> >
> >Let‚Äôs get out of nested
>
> Let‚Äôs get out of main


5. Code
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt render it. I said DON‚ÄôT. Keep it as a code.‚Äù

Write the code and give a tab to all, i.e. 4 spaces. Indent them by 4 spaces to keep them as a normal text. If you don‚Äôt indent it, it will be read as an HTML block.

Code :- (More than 1 space not allowed here)

<html>
<body>
<p>Let‚Äôs keep it as a code block and not render it for once</p>
</body>
</html>


6. Lists
Lists are very necessary for README like when you want to list the features, or languages used, etc.

Unordered List :-

* Item1
* Item2
* Item3

- Item1
- Item2
- Item3


Ordered List :-

1. Item1
2. Item2
3. Item3


7. Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___).

---

****

8. Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses. You can also simply copy paste a link.

9. Images
Images are very important to make your README attractive.

To place an image,

upload it to your repository
mention its path in the below given markdown
![Alt](path to img)

![Image](/component-library/images/website.svg)

GIF ‚Äî You can also upload a GIF. Just mention its link in place of image link. The syntax remains same.

![Main](https://media.giphy.com/media/wKoPDy4mp8Lr6IJ9ce/giphy.gif)

You can also drag and drop an image in the README. This feature has been added recently.

Drag and Drop. It‚Äôs as simple as that
11. Labels

12. Table
Well I haven‚Äôt used them yet in any of my projects but maybe you were just looking for it and I saved you.

You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row. Copy pasting code won't work.

| Header1 | Header2 | Header3 |
| ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî | ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî -| ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî |
| R1C1 | R1C2 | R1C3 |
| R2C1 | R2C2 | R2C3 |


Table
Table with Alignment :-

To align items :-

Left Align ‚Äî :---
Center Align ‚Äî :---:
Right Align ‚Äî ---:
| Header1 | Header2 | Header3 |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| R1C1 | R1C2 | R1C3 |
| R2C1 | R2C2 | R2C3 |


Table with Alignment
Note :- Copy pasting codes won‚Äôt work. I tested it. Just write on your own and it will be fine

13. Task List
Just another thing you can try to fit in somewhere in your README.

- [x] Write a blog
- [x] Make it interesting
- [ ] Publish it


Task list
14. Add COLOR
Don‚Äôt know what this is or how I can use it, but I came through this when searching for how I can add colors. I don‚Äôt think GOOGLE got me. But as I am documenting all, why leave this behind. No Prejudice.

```diff
- This is a red colored line
+ This is a green colored line
@@ This is a purple colored line @@
```



15. Write text as CODE
Do you wanna put a gray background to your text and make it appear as a code segment. This is what you need.

`Hello This is a code`

`` Using `single back ticks` inside double back ticks``



16. Add Emoji üòä
Last but not the least, do you wanna add some emojis to your README. Here is how to do it.

Go to https://emojipedia.org/
Search for the perfect emoji
Copy and paste it in the README
